# Add / Remove Items

👨‍💼 Hooray, we've got a great solution for adding multiple images to our notes.
Users are going to love this feature.

💯 Did you take the time to think about the screen reader experience of our "❌"
and "➕ Image" buttons? You can use `sr-only` and `aria-hidden` to visually
hide/show different elements for screen readers. So here's how it was
implemented in my solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler alert!</summary>

<CodeFile
	file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId_.edit.tsx"
	range="186-192,198-204"
	highlight="190-191,202-203"
/>

</details>
