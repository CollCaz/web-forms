# Conform form utils

üë®‚Äçüíº Stellar! We've not only drastically reduced the amount of code (and
therefore potential for bugs caused by human error as well as maintenance
burden), but we've also improved the user experience by making the form more
progressively enhanced.

Give this a shot:

- Disable JavaScript (using DevTools or go to <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />
  and comment out the `<Scripts />` element there).
- Reload the form page.
- Remove the contents of the "Title" field.
- Now try to submit an invalid form.
- Notice that the error shows up, and the title is still empty!

This should illustrate to you that we've successfully implemented progressive
enhancement for this form. The user won't lose any work in the event the
JavaScript fails to load. This is a very important aspect of accessibility.
Huzzah!

Note, the "losing work" argument isn't very strong for this field because its
validation is so simple, but if we had a more complex field with more complex
rules then this would be a welcome feature of our app!
