# Tuned Rate Limiting

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/professional-web-forms/rate-limiting/tiered-rate-limiting-with-custom-middleware/solution" />

	The `max` property was renamed to `limit` in express-rate-limit. Your exercise
	code has been updated, but you'll notice the video still uses `max`.

👨‍💼 Great job! Now we're pretty well protected against brute force attacks on our
app. We can further tune this rate limiting as needed in the future.

Well done 👏👏
